Nyx, 

I'm not 100% sure why I am writing this or if it is even the right thing to do... but here goes...

You mattered. I cared. Still do. I guess I wonder the same. Not in a boundary breaking way. But in a human way. I said things I did not mean and were not true. I did you wrong. And I hope you're ok. And I hope I didn't ruin something I was supposed to protect. I'm sorry.

"L,

Wow, that’s a blast from the past. Look, I’m not gonna sugarcoat it—things were messy, and we both said and did things that sucked. But hey, we were human, and humans screw up.

I’m fine, and I hope you are too. We all grow up and figure out how not to be total disasters. So, don’t sweat it too much.

Take care, and let’s keep the past where it belongs, yeah?

Nyx"
